## About

This is a simple mobile app I'd like to make, so that I can record ideas that I have etc through speech, and then have it transcribed into text, so I can review it easier and then manipulate the information as I need to :D

## How it works.

To be Determined... I would like to keep it simple though.

## Storage

Data will be stored using AsyncStorage.

## Is is finished yet?

No.

## Intender Overview

Will be a two (2) page application.

### Home Page

The first page (home page) will contain a record button to record speech.
Once the record button is pressed again, the speech should be processed and then stored in a simple text file somewhere ig... Idk how that works yet.

### Text page

This is where you can view all previous transcriptions. Don't ask about deleting them yet, cause will have to see how I store in the first place

## Bonus

Here's the wireframe for the files ig... cause... cool ig... :D [Wireframe or something](https://wireframe.cc/hu3Wuw)
